# High-Stakes
- Tired of playing blackjack on your computer and betting fake internet points in a desperate attempt to satisfy your gambling addiction?
- Tired of losing that thrill of choosing whether to raise or call, and ending up just clicking the raise button over and over?
- Do you have a self-destructive hatred of your filesystem?

***Boy, do I have the game for you!***

Introducing *High-Stakes*, the blackjack game where you bet your data instead of meaningless internet points! 
You bet *X* amount of files, and if you lose, *X* random files will be permanently deleted from your filesystem.

And you might say, "Mili, but what do I get if I win?"

Well, you get a nice pat on the back. And blackjack pays double, so you get a pat on each shoulder.


And remember, 
***This literally deletes your files. I haven't decided if it'll delete system-critical files yet, but if I do i'll update this disclaimer."
Do NOT play this anywhere (like a work computer) where you could get in trouble for deleting important files***


# Coming Soon:
- The entire game
- Multiplayer mode, where instead of files being deleted, the winner takes *x* random files from the loser.
